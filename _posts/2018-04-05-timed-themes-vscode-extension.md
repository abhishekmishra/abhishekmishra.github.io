VS Code is now my primary IDE, it's the IDE I use the most and really like. At home I use a laptop hooked to a large monitor. This setup is in a room with lots of windows and skylights. So during the day, the room lights up a lot and there are a lot of reflections on the screen. So I use a dark theme with lots of contrast during the day. But at night I use a lighter theme with less contrast. I used to switch manually with a two lines in my settings for the IDE theme which I would switch on or off.

This looked like something which could be easily automated and fun to do. And I wrote this extension called timed-themes which does just that. You specify two themes, and time ranges for the two themes in the configuration. The extension takes care of changing the theme at the appropriate times.
