# A GCD Game

Recently I've again started reading Dijkstra's book "A Discipline Of Programming". In the very first chapter "Chapter 0 on executional abstraction", he mentions a board game which when played correctly produces the GCD of two numbers. It is just an implementation of [Euclid's Algorithm]. I wanted to write a program to play this game.

I'd also discovered a library to produce svg animations called [vivus], which I wanted to try.

So here's my implementation of the GCD game in html/javascript - [GCD Board Game]. Note that the numbers are provided using URL params to the html (x, and y are the param names.)
