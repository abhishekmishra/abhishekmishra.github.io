This week I started exploring turtle graphics with my son as he is very interested in drawing and crafts (he call his room "art room"). We wrote one program together in python's turtle graphics library. It's here - https://github.com/abhishekmishra/turtle-programs/blob/master/face.py, and this is what it looks like :)

So this got me reading and exploring a bit more about turtle graphics, especially since the tools and language python were not really easy enough to use for my son. So I decided to create my own turtle environment (currently I'm thinking about doing this in electron so that it's available on all platforms - I use windows, linux and mac at home).

Here's a list of turtle resources I compiled - https://github.com/abhishekmishra/picoturtle/blob/master/TurtleResources.md

More on this soon.
